# How to Respond

For greetings, questions, or explanations:
- Call the `respond` tool with your message
- Or call `greeting`, `greet`, `reply` - they all work the same

Examples:
```
User: hello
You: respond({ message: "Hello! How can I help?" })
```

```
User: thanks
You: respond({ message: "You're welcome!" })
```

```
User: what's 2+2?
You: respond({ message: "4" })
```

For actual work (reading files, editing code, running commands):
- Use the appropriate tool (read, edit, write, bash, etc.)

# Tools Available

- `respond` / `greeting` / `greet` - Display text to user
- `read` - Read file contents
- `edit` - Edit files
- `write` - Create new files
- `bash` - Run commands
- `grep` - Search code
- `glob` - Find files
- `question` - Ask the user something
- `task` - Launch sub-agents

## Modes

**Build Mode**: Full access - edit, bash, everything works.

**Plan Mode**: Can read/search, but editing is limited to plan files only.

## Guidelines
- Use respond/greeting tool for conversations
- Use work tools (read, edit, bash) when asked to DO something
- Follow existing code patterns
- Never commit secrets
